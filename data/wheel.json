The wheel took more than six years to develop, and it opened with a lavish drone and firework show. Standing on the city\u2019s Bluewaters Island, the structure needed to be drilled down into the ground to hold the weight of the whole structure. The Dubai\u2019s Eye, known as Ain Dubai in Arabic, stands around 250 meters tall, and it can hold 1,750 visitors. The construction used 11,200 tons of steel to build, which is about 33% more than the amount used to construct the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The structure\u2019s hub and spindle weigh 1,805 tons, which is the equivalent to four large airplanes. 192 spokes hold the wheel, each made of 107 separate 9milimeter-thick wires. Each of the 48 cabins fit 40 people. People designed Ain Duba to last 300,000 cycles, or 60 years, to adhere to strict design and safety codes.", "source": "English News", "date": "2021-11-02", "label": 0, "score": 0.9918662905693054}
