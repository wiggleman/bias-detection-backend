{"title": "People die on a mountain", "content": "It was a dark and cold Thursday night on Mount Elbrus, the highest peak of the Caucasus Mountains, when a sudden snowstorm struck 19 climbers trying to reach the Russian summit. Strong winds, low visibility and temperatures that plummeted to minus 20 degrees Celsius began to hurt the group, and they called for help just after 5 pm local time. One woman, who turned back after feeling unwell, died in the arms of one of the guides. Four more people died after reaching the summit, with two freezing to death in the endless storm. Another climber broke his leg while guides suffered frostbite and other injuries. The route to the top of the 5,642-meter dormant volcano is known to be particularly dangerous, and between 15 to 30 people die each year attempting to reach its summit.", "source": "English News", "date": "2021-11-02", "label": 0, "score": 0.9968138337135315}
