{"title": "Chile Protests", "content": "Last week, hundreds of Chileans protested in the streets against immigration, while burning tents and items belonging to migrants in the northern Chilean port city of Iquique. The protests came after the government evicted a controversial Venezuelan-majority migrant camp that had existed for a year in the town square. Then it was declared a health risk. Most of the migrants, poor and undocumented, were stranded in the city and survived on odd jobs with no way to reach the capital. Hundreds of families who lived at the square wandered in various public places, and tried to settle with tents on the beaches where hotels and apartments are also along the sand. Chile is South America\u00b4s wealthiest country. Venezuela, on the other hand, is in an unprecedented economic and political crisis that has led millions of people to leave their country. Venezuela\u00b4s national currency has lost 73 of its value to the dollar so far this year, and its inflation is about 3,000%.", "source": "English News", "date": "2021-11-02", "label": 0, "score": 0.9954332113265991}
